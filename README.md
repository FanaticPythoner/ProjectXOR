Heavily multithreaded tool for bruteforcing XOR Encryption. Multiple options available for specific bruteforcing rules. Made in Visual Studio 2017 in C#.

# Installation :

Well the software is made in C#, so you need the .NET Framwework installed( If you don't have it installed, when you wil try to open the software, Windows will give you the choice to install it). Run the Xorfind.exe file in the bin/Debug folder. If you dont trust the compiled executable, just re-build it through Visual Studio. You have access to the source code.

# Usage

Well it is pretty damn easy to use.
